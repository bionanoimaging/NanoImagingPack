def radial_profile(data, center=None, binsize=1.0):
    '''
    calculates the radial profile of an image
    the original code is from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21242011/most-efficient-way-to-calculate-radial-profile

    Parameters
    ----------
    data: data to calcuate the profile form
    center (default=None): center from where to calculate the radius. None means the (Fourier-) middle of the image is used.
    binsize (default=1.0): size of each bin

    Returns
    -------
    One-D radial profile
