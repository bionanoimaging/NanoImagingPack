Description: This is a package for simple image processing.
        It is oriented on the DIP-Image package, which is available for Matlab. 
        Goal is to keep things simple and make it available for a broad community. Hence its development aimed for:
        
        	- Make it independent from as much packages as possible -> it only requires a view Python packages. Some are provided by e.g. Anaconda (e.g. Numpy, pyPlot, inspect, scipy). Only tifffile (a 3D Tiff writer) is required as external package
        
        	- keep it simple to install 
        
        
        Getting started:
        	- The created image is of type "image"
        	- the command lookfor('some string') allows you to search for available methods
        	- view() provides a simple image viewer (up to 6 dimensions) -> press 'h' to get help on view()
        	- graph() provides a simple viewer for 2D graphs -> you can add lists for multiple graphs
        	- supports:
        		multidimensional fft/ifft 
        		image alignment
        		finding for SLM based SIM images
        		Controlling Hamamatsu LCOS SLM
        		Creating OTFs, PSFs etc
        		Image manipulation (convolution, (simple) EdgeDamping, extracting, catting)
        		helper functions such as ramps, xx, yy, zz, freq/realspace coord transforms
        
        
        Should not require any dependencies up to now, which are not available in Anaconda, except of tifffile reader "tifffile"
        
        If installation parser fails to install tifffile install it via:
        
        conda install -c conda-forge tifffile
