Description: This is a package for simple image processing.
        It is oriented on the DIP-Image package, which is available for Matlab. 
        Goal is to keep things simple and make it available for a broad community. Hence its development aimed for:
        
        	- Make it independent from as much packages as possible -> it only requires a view Python packages. Some are provided by e.g. Anaconda (e.g. Numpy, pyPlot, inspect, scipy). Only tifffile (a 3D Tiff writer) is required as external package
        	- keep it simple to install 
        
        
        Getting started:
        	- The created image is of type "image"
        
        	- the command lookfor('some string') allows you to search for available methods
        
        	- view() or vv() provides an image viewer
        	    - The default viewer is currently Napari, but this can be changed by
        
        	    	setDefault('IMG_VIEWER',myViewer) with myViewer being one of 'NIP_VIEW', 'VIEW5D','NAPARI','INFO'
        	        - in NIP_VIEW press 'h' to get help. In VIEW5d press "?"
        
        	- graph() provides a simple viewer for 2D graphs -> you can add lists for multiple graphs
        
        	- supports:
        
        		multidimensional fft/ifft
        
        		image alignment
        
        		finding for SLM based SIM images
        
        		Controlling Hamamatsu LCOS SLM
        
        		Creating OTFs, PSFs etc.
        
        		Image manipulation (convolution, (simple) EdgeDamping, extracting, concattenating, Fourier-space extractions and padding)
        
        		helper functions such as ramps, xx, yy, zz, freq/realspace coord transforms
