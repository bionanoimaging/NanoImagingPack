Up until now I haven't set the dependency installation correctly. Majorly, as the final package shall be a conda-package rather than a pip package

If you have anaconda already installed (and I highly recommend to do so) you only have to install 2 dependency packages:

	tifffile
	javabridge (for using VIEW5D)

If you are not using anaconda you have to install a lot of extra packages IN ADDITION such as:
	numpy
	scipy
	re
	inspect
	... (you will get error messages when running the NanoImagingPack and then install those)


tifffile
========

Install the tiff handler tifffile via

conda install -c conda-forge tifffile


pyjnius for VIEW5D
==================

Rainers cool viewer requires the Java Virtual machine and javabridge. That has to be set up.
!!! Note you should use anaconda for successfully running this package!!!

1.) Windows:

	a. install javabridge (type in cmd):
		conda install -c conda-forge javabridge

	b. set up Java
		- Download JRE from 
			https://java.com/en/download/

		- set up environment variables:
			* at the system PATH variable add the java\bin folder (should contain java.exe):
					C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_201\bin    (in my case!)
			
			* if you installed Python only for your account: 
				- add new Variable (at user variables): 
					Name = JAVA_HOME
					Value = java\bin folder (should contain java.exe; C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_201\bin   in my case!)
				- add the folder that contains jvm.dll to user variable PATH (should be C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_201\bin\server)
								
			* if you installed Python only for your account: 
				- do the same as above but for the system variables instead of the user variable

2.) Linux:
	a. install pyjnius (type in cmd):
		conda install -c conda-forge javabridge

	b. install java runtime environment (if not yet done, acutally linux should have that)
		- note openJDK7 or 6 (as in my Ubuntu V14 only availible) will not work
		- however an openJDK11 will be installed automatically, once you install javabridge via conda
		- it is found in the site packages folder of your Anaconda installation (e.g. /home/christian/anaconda3/pkgs/openjdk-11.0.1-h14c3975_1014/

	c. set up JAVA_HOME: 
		- Check if set via
				echo $JAVA_HOME
		- If nothing appears its not set (or points towards an opendJDK6 or 7 version), set it:
			
			- edit the file /etc/environment
			- add the line JAVA_HOME="/home/christian/anaconda3/pkgs/openjdk-11.0.1-h14c3975_1014/" (or the your JAVA HOME folder)
			- reboot
			- if you have an open JDK8 or 11 version installed you should be able to use its path for the JAVA_HOME-dir as well
		- NOTE: Editing of /etc/environment will permanently add the JAVA_HOME, some people consider this to be not nice. You can also add it at every session new via:
				export JAVA_HOME="/home/christian/anaconda3/pkgs/openjdk-11.0.1-h14c3975_1014/"
